# Muhammed Qureshi Portfolio Site

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. The website serves as an online showcase of my projects and services.

## Technologies Used

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
